# Process_SMOS_L1C
Octave/Matlab rapid processor for SMOS satellite brightness temperature L1C data


Process_SMOSxL1C is a MEX-function written in C++ to process L1C scientific data producs from the MIRAS interferometer on board of the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite, a European Space Agency mission.
The L1C data product comes with data for brightness temperature at L-band in dual-polarization or full-polarization (4 Stokes vector) mode. 

The MEX-function comes in two flavors: as MATLAB function and as a GNU/Octave function. The MATLAB function has as file name "Process\_SMOSxL1C.mexa64", while the Octave function is named as "Process\_SMOSxL1C.mex".

The Function has been tested under MATLAB version 2007, 2010b, 2016a.

For information about how to compile and examples how to run the function, see the wiki page in this repository.

For technical details about what is implemented in the MEX-function, see the Open Access paper:
